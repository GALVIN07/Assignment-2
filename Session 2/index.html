    <p id="intro">I always find these about me assignments to be a little tricky and a bit interesting. I believe this topic is and should be a constantly evolving document. If you had asked me five years ago to write the same assignment, surely I would have written something completely different and for that reason I find it best to break this down into two catagories; the key events and experiences that have impacted me and how I reacted to and who I chose to be as a result of those events. </p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="width: 20%;" class="subheading">Life Events and Experiences</h2>
    <P> I was raised by a single mother with 3 sibilings, one younger sister and two older brothers. My mother was a hard working single mother oftern working over time just to make ends meet. My brothers and I would often be home alone and responsible for things like dinner and house work, however, we still found plenty of time to explore our neighborhood, building forts and playing games with other neighborhood kids. Our youngest sister was often an unwelcome tag along, but we nonetheless felt a great responsibility for her protection and well being. Academically, I would struggle greatly beggining in highschool, not due to a lack of intelligence or understand, but rather a lack of desire and overall boredom where school and homework were concerned. Upon graduation, by the skin of my teeth, I immediataly joined the USMC and embraced the military life completely. I absolutely loved the service. I had high hopes after my seperation from the armed forces, finding success in sales with a rapid claim up the ranks.</p>

    <h3 style="width: 10%;" class="subheading">Who I Am</h3>
    <P>In an attempt to describe who I am today, given the context of my early life experiences, I would say I am highley independant and drawn to activities that require a certain level of initiatve and self reliance. I look for a lot of autonomy in my career choice, both in income and effort which are often directly linked. I appreciate the example that was set for me by a hard working mother as a child and know inherently that there is no substitute for effort. I enjoy competative sports and the comradarie it creates as it reminds me of my time in the service. Hockey is my game of choice and you will not find a bigger Anahiem Ducks Fan. I enjoy the outdoors and challanging hikes or backpacking trips. I am a fiercly loyal friend and family advocate. I believe the strong have a duty to stand up for those who cannot stand themselves. While my approach to life may continue to evolve and change, this is the bedrock of who I am. Thank you for reading! </P>
